## Usage

### Responding to Invites

Guests who have received invites may respond from the home page without having to create an account on the system.

- **Organizer's Principal ID**: Obtain from organizer. For testing, use the `OrgId` generated in the console after login
- **Family Name**: The principal guest who received the Invite, either for themself in their individual capacity or representing a group of other guests
- **Invite Code**: The invite code on the Invite

### Managing Invites

Administrator users who have logged in successfully may manage invites. The Invites page is a bird's eye view of all invites generated by the user on the system, with options to quickly mark **Responded**, **Attending**, **Update**, **Attach** and **Delete** an invite.

Users can also quickly add an invite by typing in a **Family Name** and selecting the **Type** of Invite, which is either of *In-person Guest* or *Zoom*.

Upon creating a new invite, the system will automatically queue for a QR code to be generated and attached to the invite. A new primary guest will be automatically created and associated with the Family Name of the invite. At this time, it is only possible to have one guest on the invite. Edit capabilities will be added in a future iteration.

Within the individual invite view, users can edit the invite or attach files one at a time to the invite.
